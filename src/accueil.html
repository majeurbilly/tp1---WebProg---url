                        The GOBLEU (Greenhouse gas Observations of Biospheric and Local Emissions from the Upper sky)
                        Project is a monitoring project to monitor Japan's subnational climate mitigation progress by
                        applying the technologies of the Greenhouse Gases Observing SATellite "IBUKI" (GOSAT) to make
                        observations of urban greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide), air quality (nitrogen dioxide) and
                        solar induced chlorophyl fluorescence (SIF) from the windows of passenger airplanes.
                        By combining data from space and the sky it seeks to make visible the emissions of
                        greenhouse gases from individual source sectors, such as transportation and industry.
                        As SUTO Hiroshi, Associate Senior Researcher at JAXA explains: "As IBUKI makes its
                        observations from space, it is rather difficult to capture the individual greenhouse gas
                        emission sources in urban areas. But by combining the IBUKI data with the data obtained from
                        passenger airplanes, we are aiming to ascertain more accurate emission estimates from
                        individual source sectors. If we can derive measures to reduce greenhouse gases from this
                        data, we hope that it will tie in with the promotion of effective global warming
                        countermeasures." It was while on a business trip that Suto hit upon the concept.
                        When he half-jokingly proposed the idea to his research group, things progressed at once.
                        First of all they checked which wavelength transmits through a window of passenger airplanes.
                        Once it was clear that observations could be satisfactorily made, JAXA's monitoring
                        instruments were taken aboard a passenger airplane operated by ANA Holdings Inc., and
                        observations started on a regular basis last October on ANA flights between Tokyo's Haneda
                        Airport and Fukuoka Airport. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of making observations
                        from passenger airplanes, the project is first of all concentrating on observations of the
                        nitrogen dioxide (NO2) that is simultaneously emitted with carbon dioxide (CO2) in the
                        combustion process. Suto says: "The COVID-19 crisis restricted the number of observations
                        we could make, but upon comparing the observational data from the passenger airplanes with
                        the observational data from IBUKI we were able to clearly capture the spatial distribution
                        of nitrogen dioxide beneath the flight path. This provides us with an indicator showing the
                        emission and spatial distribution of greenhouse gases from urban areas.
                        The ultimate target of GOBLEU is to clarify greenhouse gas "emissions" and "absorption."
                        According to Suto, because greenhouse gas concentrations change due to the impact of wind
                        direction and wind speed, the project is currently at the stage of increasing the frequency
                        of observations. "We first of all hope to increase the data, and thereby minimize the margin
                        of error in order to estimate emissions. We also intend to expand observations by using the
                        air route between Tokyo and Sapporo, and want to tie this in with ascertaining the volume of
                        greenhouse gas absorbed by forested areas. We are pursuing more compact instruments with the
                        hope of conducting observations like a video camera in the future."
